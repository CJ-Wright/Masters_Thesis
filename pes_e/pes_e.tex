\chapter{Statistical Mechanical Ensembles and Potential Energy Surfaces} \label{ch:pes_e}
\section{Introduction}
The approach taken in this work for solving the atomic structures of materials is one of optimization.
The plan is to develop a potential energy surface (PES) which has minima associated with atomic structures who's properties match the experimentally observed properties.
Thus, the various positional variables of the structure can be solved by optimizing the structure against the PES.
This approach is popular in the PDF community for solving the structure of materials using both extensive large box models and simpler small box models.

In this chapter we discuss the development of the various PESs used in the PDF community for comparing theoretical and experimental PDFs.
Special attention will be paid to the gradients of the potential energy functions, as these are important to some optimization techniques.
Additionally, we also discuss the use of statistical mechanical ensembles for finding minima on the PES.

\section{Conclusions}
In this chapter we have presented the development of both PES and the statistical mechanical ensembles used to search them.
We expanded the classical concept of a PES to a more general mapping from positional variable space to energy space.
This expansion allowed for the implementation of experimentally derived PES, where the disagreement between experimental and computed results can be included in the PES.
Common experimental PESs were discussed, and their forces derived.
The implementation of various statistical mechanical ensembles, used for searching the PES for minima, was also discussed with a special focus on No-U-Turn-Sampling Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
Grand Canonical Monte Carlo was also discussed, with an emphasis on the us of biasing to increase the overall acceptance rate.
Future work in this area may include the development of PESs which leverage 2 dimensional data, like STEM images, or ensembles which help to eliminate tuned parameters like parallel tempering.
