abstract = {We report a combined synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction study on as-grown La2CoO4.14 single- crystal from 10 to 470 K. Unprecedented structural features in terms of a (3 + 2)D incommensurate modulation have been detected and characterized in the Low Temperature Orthorhombic (LTO) phase already at room temperature despite the complex twinning that was unravelled. A new intermediate phase between the LTO and High Temperature Tetragonal (HTT) phases has been observed for the first time (in the range of 413−433 K). The transformation from LTO to this so-called HTLO (High Temperature Less Ortho- rhombic) phase is associated to a lowering of orthorhombicity and a loss of one modulation vector, yielding a (3 + 1)D incommensurate modulation. Conversely, above 433 K the HTT phase appears as nonmodulated but exhibits a strong dynamic disorder of CoO6 octahedra, which has been characterized in detail by reconstruction of nuclear densities via the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM).},

abstract = {The structure of oxygen-intercalated $\backslash$ce{\{}La{\_}2CuO{\_}{\{}4.07{\}}{\}} has been investigated at 20 and 300{\~{}}K by neutron diffraction on an electrochemically oxidized single crystal. At 20{\~{}}K, reconstruction of the nuclear density by maximum entropy method shows strong displacements of the apical oxygen atoms towards [100] with respect to the {\$}F{\$}-centered unit cell, whilst displacements towards [110] and [100] were both found to be present at ambient temperature. Combining strucutal studies with first-principles lattice dynamical calculations, we interpret the displacements of the apical oxygen atoms to be at least partially of dynamic origin already at ambient temperature. Strong displacements of the apical oxygen atoms of stoichiometric and oxygen-doped $\backslash$ce{\{}La{\_}2CuO{\_}{\{}4+{\$}\backslashdelta{\$}{\}}{\}} and corresponding associated lattice instabilites, i.e. low-energy phonon modes, are considered as a general prerequisite of low-tempeature oxygen diffusion mechanisms. Lattice dynamical calculations on $\backslash$ce{\{}La{\_}2CuO{\_}{\{}4+{\$}\backslashdelta{\$}{\}}{\}} suggest that the oxygen species diffusing at low temperature are not the interstitial but, more prominently, the apical oxygen atoms. The presence of interstitial oxygen atoms is, however, important to amplify via specific low-energy phonon modes, a dynamic exchange mechanism between apical and vacant interstitial oxygen sites, thus allowing a dynamically triggerede, shallow potential oxygen diffusion pathway. The crucial role of lattice dynamics to enable low-temperature oxygen mobility in $\backslash$ce{\{}K{\_}2NiF{\_}4{\}}-type oxides is discussed on a microscopic scale and compared to similar low-temperature oxygen diffusion mechanisms, recently proposed for non-stoichiometric oxides with Brownmillerite-type structure.},

abstract = {Despite the enormous investments made in collecting DNA samples and generating germline variation data across thousands of individuals in modern genome-wide association studies (GWAS), progress has been frustratingly slow in explaining much of the heritability in common disease. Today's paradigm of testing independent hypotheses on each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker is unlikely to adequately reflect the complex biological processes in disease risk. Alternatively, modeling risk as an ensemble of SNPs that act in concert in a pathway, and/or interact non-additively on log risk for example, may be a more sensible way to approach gene mapping in modern studies. Implementing such analyzes genome-wide can quickly become intractable due to the fact that even modest size SNP panels on modern genotype arrays (500k markers) pose a combinatorial nightmare, require tens of billions of models to be tested for evidence of interaction. In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of programs that have been developed to explicitly overcome these enormous computational barriers through the use of processors on graphics cards known as Graphics Processing Units (GPU). We include tutorials on GPU technology, which will convey why they are growing in appeal with today's numerical scientists. One obvious advantage is the impressive density of microprocessor cores that are available on only a single GPU. Whereas high end servers feature up to 24 Intel or AMD CPU cores, the latest GPU offerings from nVidia feature over 2600 cores. Each compute node may be outfitted with up to 4 GPU devices. Success on GPUs varies across problems. However, epistasis screens fare well due to the high degree of parallelism exposed in these problems. Papers that we review routinely report GPU speedups of over two orders of magnitude ({\textgreater}100x) over standard CPU implementations.},

Examples are nanoparticles, nanotubes, amorphous matter, polymers, and macromolecules in suspension. For such systems the computation of powder diffraction patterns (which may provide an efficient characterization) is to be performed the hard way, by summing contributions from each atom pair. This work deals with performing such computation in the most practical and efficient way. Three main points are developed: how to encode the enormous array of interatomic distances (which increase as the square or higher powers of the cluster diameter) to a much smaller array of equispaced values on a coarse grid (whose size increases linearly with the diameter); how to perform a fast computation of the diffraction pattern from this equispaced grid; how to optimize the grid step to obtain an arbitrarily small error on the computed diffraction pattern. Theory and examples are jointly developed and presented.},

The algorithm groups pixels into bins of size such that the fractional error on the photon count in a bin is less than or equal to a threshold value, and the size of the bin is as small as possible. The process is particularly useful for generating surface brightness and colour maps, with clearly defined error maps, from images with a large dynamic range of counts, for example X-ray images of galaxy clusters. We demonstrate the method in application to data from Chandra ACIS-S and ACIS-I observations of the Perseus cluster of galaxies. We use the algorithm to create intensity maps, and colour images which show the relative X-ray intensities in different bands. The colour maps can later be converted, through spectral models, into maps of physical parameters, such as temperature, column density, etc. The adaptive binning algorithm is applicable to a wide range of data, from observations or numerical simulations, and is not limited to two-dimensional data.},

abstract = {For obtaining reliable nanostructural details of large amounts of sample—and if it is applicable—small-angle scattering (SAS) is a prime technique to use. It promises to obtain bulk-scale, statistically sound information on the morphological details of the nanostructure, and has thus led to many a researcher investing their time in it over the last eight decades of development. Due to pressure from scientists requesting more details on increasingly complex nanostructures, as well as the ever improving instrumentation leaving less margin for ambiguity, small-angle scattering methodologies have been evolving at a high pace over the past few decades. As the quality of any results can only be as good as the data that go into these methodologies, the improvements in data collection and all imaginable data correction steps are reviewed here. This work is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of all data corrections, to aid the small-angle scatterer to decide which are relevant for their measurement and how these corrections are performed. Clear mathematical descriptions of the corrections are provided where feasible. Furthermore, as no quality data exist without a decent estimate of their precision, the error estimation and propagation through all these steps are provided alongside the corrections.With these data corrections, the collected small-angle scattering pattern can be made of the highest standard, allowing for authoritative nanostructural characterization through its analysis. A brief background of small-angle scattering, the instrumentation developments over the years, and pitfalls that may be encountered upon data interpretation are provided as well.},

abstract = {Optimal methods are explored for obtaining one-dimensional powder pattern intensities from two-dimensional planar detectors with good estimates of their standard deviations. Methods are described to estimate uncertainties when the same image is measured in multiple frames as well as from a single frame. The importance of considering the correlation of diffraction points during the integration and the resampling process of data analysis is shown. It is found that correlations between adjacent pixels in the image can lead to seriously overestimated uncertainties if such correlations are neglected in the integration process. Off-diagonal entries in the variance-covariance (VC) matrix are problematic as virtually all data processing and modeling programs cannot handle the full VC matrix. It is shown that the off-diagonal terms come mainly from the pixel-splitting algorithm used as the default integration algorithm in many popular two-dimensional integration programs, as well as from rebinning and resampling steps later in the processing. When the full VC matrix can be propagated during the data reduction, it is possible to get accurate refined parameters and their uncertainties at the cost of increasing computational complexity. However, as this is not normally possible, the best approximate methods for data processing in order to estimate uncertainties on refined parameters with the greatest accuracy from just the diagonal variance terms in the VC matrix is explored.},

abstract = {2D area detectors like CCD or pixel detectors have become popular in the last 15 years for diffraction experiments (e.g. for WAXS, SAXS, single crystal and powder diffraction (XRPD)). These detectors have a large sensitive area of millions of pixels with high spatial resolution. The software package pyFAI has been designed to reduce SAXS, WAXS and XRPD images taken with those detectors into 1D curves (azimuthal integration) usable by other software for in-depth analysis such as Rietveld refinement, or 2D images (a radial transformation named caking). As a library, the aim of pyFAI is to be integrated into other tools like PyMca or EDNA with a clean pythonic interface. However pyFAI features also command line tools for batch processing, converting data into q-space (q being the momentum transfer) or 2$\theta$-space ($\theta$ being the Bragg angle) and a calibration graphical interface for optimizing the geometry of the experiment using the Debye-Scherrer rings of a reference sample. PyFAI shares the geometry definition of SPD but can directly import geometries determined by the software FIT2D. PyFAI has been designed to work with any kind of detector and geometry (transmission or reflection) and relies on FabIO, a library able to read more than 20 image formats produced by detectors from 12 different manufacturers. During the transformation from cartesian space (x,y) to polar space (2$\theta$, $\chi$), both local and total intensities are conserved in order to obtain accurate quantitative results. Technical details on how this integration is implemented and how it has been ported to native code and parallelized on graphic cards are discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Shape-selective monometallic nanocatalysts offer activity benefits based on structural sensitivity and high surface area. In bimetallic nanoalloys with well-defined shape, site-dependent metal surface segregation additionally affects the catalytic activity and stability. However, segregation on shaped alloy nanocatalysts and their atomic-scale evolution is largely unexplored. Exemplified by three octahedral PtxNi1-x alloy nanoparticle electrocatalysts with unique activity for the oxygen reduction reaction at fuel cell cathodes, we reveal an unexpected compositional segregation structure across the {\{}111{\}} facets using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. In contrast to theoretical predictions, the pristine PtxNi1-x nano-octahedra feature a Pt-rich frame along their edges and corners, whereas their Ni atoms are preferentially segregated in their {\{}111{\}} facet region. We follow their morphological and compositional evolution in electrochemical environments and correlate this with their exceptional catalytic activity. The octahedra preferentially leach in their facet centres and evolve into 'concave octahedra'. More generally, the segregation and leaching mechanisms revealed here highlight the complexity with which shape-selective nanoalloys form and evolve under reactive conditions.},

The new techniques result in a substantial improvement in the efficiency of the simulations compared to traditional GCMC. The adsorption thermodynamics and molecular-level structure were studied for benzene and p-xylene in silicalite with Pnma symmetry (ORTHO) and P2,2121 symmetry (PARA). The subtle differences between ORTHO and PARA silicalite result in qualitatively different sorption behavior. An explanation of the experimentally observed step in the adsorption isotherm is presented, based on the results of the simulations and the ORTHO to PARA framework transformation that is observed experimentally. Predictions of the adsorption isotherms, isosteric heats, and siting locations of the adsorbates are in good agreement with experiment.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

However, for ultrasmall nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm, the models cannot fit the experimental PDF showing that the structure is significantly modified from that of larger particles and the bulk.

Instead of the commonly used fixed neighbor constraints, where molecules are held together by constraining distance ranges available for the specified atom pairs, here molecules are kept together via bond, angle, and dihedral potential energies. The scaled total potential energy contributes to the measure of the goodness-of-fit, thus, the atoms can be prevented from drifting apart. In some of the calculations (Lennard-Jones and Coulombic) nonbonding potentials were also applied. The algorithm was successfully tested for the X-ray structure factor-based structure study of liquid dimethyl trisulfide, for which material now significantly more sensible results have been obtained than during previous attempts via any earlier version of RMC modeling. It is envisaged that structural modeling of a large class of materials, primarily liquids and amorphous solids containing molecules of up to about 100 atoms, will make use of the new code in the near future.},

We are able to follow a 100-ps coherent acoustic pulse, generated through optical excitation of the crystal surface, as it propagates through the X-ray penetration depth.

abstract = {▪ Abstract Areal density progress in magnetic recording is largely determined by the ability to fabricate low-noise, granular thin lm media with sufficient stability against thermal agitation to warrant long-term data storage. A key requirement is a medium microstructure with small, magnetically isolated grains to establish optimal macro- and micro-magnetic properties. A lower bound for the minimal average grain diameter, compatible with thermal stability, is imposed by the write field capability of the recording head. It is 10–12 nm assuming maximal writeable coercivities of 400 kA/m (5000 Oe). These are already achieved in today's state-of-the-art CoCr-based thin lm alloy media, leaving little room for further improvements and density gains based on continued grain size reduction. A threefold reduction in grain diameter, however, translating into a tenfold increase in areal density is theoretically possible if write field constraints can be overcome, allowing utilization of magnetically harder alloys.

abstract = {Alloying palladium (Pd) with other transition metals at the nanoscale has become an important pathway for preparation of low-cost, highly active and stable catalysts. However, the lack of understanding of how the alloying phase state, chemical composition and atomic-scale structure of the alloys at the nanoscale influence their catalytic activity impedes the rational design of Pd-nanoalloy catalysts. This work addresses this challenge by a novel approach to investigating the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) over palladium-nickel (PdNi) nanoalloys with well-defined bimetallic composition, which reveals a remarkable maximal catalytic activity at Pd:Ni ratio of {\~{}}50:50. Key to understanding the structural-catalytic synergy is the use of high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction coupled to atomic pair distribution function (HE-XRD/PDF) analysis to probe the atomic structure of PdNi nanoalloys under controlled thermochemical treatments and CO reaction conditions. Three-dimensional (3D) models of the atomic structure of the nanoalloy particles were generated by reverse Monte Carlo simulations (RMC) guided by the experimental HE-XRD/PDF data. Structural details of the PdNi nanoalloys were extracted from the respective 3D models and compared with the measured catalytic properties. The comparison revealed a strong correlation between the phase state, chemical composition and atomic-scale structure of PdNi nanoalloys and their catalytic activity for CO oxidation. This correlation is further substantiated by analyzing the first atomic neighbor distances and coordination numbers inside the nanoalloy particles and at their surfaces. These findings have provided new insights into the structural synergy of nanoalloy catalysts by controlling the phase state, composition and atomic structure, complementing findings of traditional density functional theory studies.},

abstract = {Although the vast majority of hydrocarbon fuels and products are presently derived from petroleum, there is much interest in the development of routes for synthesizing these same products by hydrogenating CO2. The simplest hydrocarbon target is methane, which can utilize existing infrastructure for natural gas storage, distribution, and consumption. Electrochemical methods for methanizing CO2 currently suffer from a combination of low activities and poor selectivities. We demonstrate that copper nanoparticles supported on glassy carbon (n-Cu/C) achieve up to 4 times greater methanation current densities compared to high-purity copper foil electrodes. The n-Cu/C electrocatalyst also exhibits an average Faradaic efficiency for methanation of 80{\%} during extended electrolysis, the highest Faradaic efficiency for room-temperature methanation reported to date. We find that the level of copper catalyst loading on the glassy carbon support has an enormous impact on the morphology of the copper under catalytic conditions and the resulting Faradaic efficiency for methane. The improved activity and Faradaic efficiency for methanation involves a mechanism that is distinct from what is generally thought to occur on copper foils. Electrochemical data indicate that the early steps of methanation on n-Cu/C involve a pre-equilibrium one-electron transfer to CO2 to form an adsorbed radical, followed by a rate-limiting non-electrochemical step in which the adsorbed CO2 radical reacts with a second CO2 molecule from solution. These nanoscale copper electrocatalysts represent a first step toward the preparation of practical methanation catalysts that can be incorporated into membrane-electrode assemblies in electrolyzers.},

abstract = {High-energy X-ray and spallation neutron total scattering data provide information about each pair of atoms in a nanoparticle sample, allowing for quantitative whole-particle structural modeling based on pair distribution function analysis. The realization of this capability has been hindered by a lack of versatile tools for describing complex finite structures. Here, the implementation of whole-particle refinement for complete nanoparticle systems is described within two programs, DISCUS and DIFFEV, and the diverse capabilities they present are demonstrated. The build-up of internal atomic structure (including defects, chemical ordering and other types of disorder), and nanoparticle size, shape and architecture (including core-shell structures, surface relaxation and ligand capping), are demonstrated using the program DISCUS. The structure refinement of a complete nanoparticle system (4 nm Au particles with organic capping ligands at the surface), based on neutron pair distribution function data, is demonstrated using DIFFEV, a program using a differential evolutionary algorithm to generate parameter values. These methods are a valuable addition to other probes appropriate for nanomaterials, adaptable to a diverse and complex set of materials systems, and extendable to additional data-set types.},

In this work, we combined density-functional theory calculations with atomic configurations generated by the basin hopping Monte Carlo algorithm within the empirical Sutton- Chen embedded atom potential. We identified alternative lower energy configurations compared with the ICO and CUB model structures, e.g., our lowest energy structures are 5.22 eV ?Pt55? and 2.01 eV ?Au55? lower than ICO. The energy gain is obtained by the Pt and Au diffusion from the ICO core region to the NP surface, which is driven by surface compression ?only 12 atoms? on the ICO core region. Therefore, in the lowest energy configurations, the core size reduces from 13 atoms ?ICO, CUB? to about 9 atoms while the NP surface increases from 42 atoms ?ICO, CUB? to about 46 atoms. The present mechanism can provide an improved atom-level understanding of small TM NPs reconstructions.},

abstract = {Amorphous titania (TiO2) is an important precursor for synthesis of single-phase nanocrystalline anatase. We synthesized amorphous titania by hydrolysis of titanium ethoxide at the ice point. Transmission electron microscopy examination and nitrogen gas adsorption indicated that the particle size of the synthesized titania is ∼2 nm. Synchrotron wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) was used to probe the atomic correlations in this amorphous sample. Atomic pair-distribution function (PDF) derived from Fourier transform of the WAXS data was used for reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations of the atomic structure of the amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles. Molecular-dynamics simulations were used to generate input structures for the RMC. X-ray-absorption spectroscopy (XAS) simulations were used to screen candidate structures obtained from the RMC by comparing with experimental XAS data. The structure model that best describes both the WAXS and XAS data shows that amorphous TiO2 particles consist of a highly distorted shell and a small strained anataselike crystalline core. The average coordination number of Ti is 5.3 and most Ti-O bonds are populated around 1.940 {\AA}. Relative to bulk TiO2, the reduction in the coordination number is primarily due to the truncation of the Ti-O octahedra at the amorphous nanoparticle surface and the shortening of the Ti-O bond length to the bond contraction in the distorted shell. The pre-existence of the anataselike core may be critical to the formation of single-phase nanocrystalline anatase in crystallization of amorphous TiO2 upon heating.},

abstract = {A long-standing puzzle regarding the disparity of local and long-range CuO6 octahedral tilt correlations in the underdoped regime of La2−xBaxCuO4 is addressed by utilizing complementary neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) approaches.This system is of interest because of the strong depression of the bulk superconducting transition at x = 1/8 in association with charge and spin stripe order. The latter unidirectional order is tied to Cu-O bond-length anisotropy present in the so-called low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase. On warming, the lattice exhibits two sequential structural transitions, involving changes in the CuO6 tilt pattern, first to the low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) and then the high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) phase. Despite the changes in static order, inspection of the instantaneous local atomic structure suggests that the LTT-type tilts persist through the transitions. Analysis of the INS spectra for the x = 1/8 composition reveals the dynamic nature of the LTT-like tilt fluctuations within the LTO and HTT phases. Within the low-temperature phase, the Cu-O bond-length splitting inferred from lattice symmetry and fitted atomic position parameters reaches a maximum of 0.3{\%} at x = 1/8, suggesting that electron-phonon coupling may contribute to optimizing the structure to stabilize stripe order. This splitting is much too small to be resolved in the pair distribution function, and in fact we do not resolve any enhancement of the instantaneous bond-length distribution in association with stripe order. This study exemplifies the importance of a systematic approach using complementary techniques when investigating systems exhibiting a large degree of complexity and subtle structural responses.},

abstract = {The mean-square relative displacements (MSRD) of atomic pair motions in crystals are studied as a function of pair distance and temperature using the atomic pair distribution function (PDF). The effects of the lattice vibrations on the PDF peak widths are modelled using both a multi-parameter Born von-Karman (BvK) force model and a single-parameter Debye model. These results are compared to experimentally determined PDFs. We find that the near-neighbor atomic motions are strongly correlated, and that the extent of this correlation depends both on the interatomic interactions and crystal structure. These results suggest that proper account of the lattice vibrational effects on the PDF peak width is important in extracting information on static disorder in a disordered system such as an alloy. Good agreement is obtained between the BvK model calculations of PDF peak widths and the experimentally determined peak widths. The Debye model successfully explains the average, though not detailed, natures of the MSRD of atomic pair motion with just one parameter. Also the temperature dependence of the Debye model largely agrees with the BvK model predictions. Therefore, the Debye model provides a simple description of the effects of lattice vibrations on the PDF peak widths.},

abstract = {We have systematically studied the optimal real-space sampling of atomic pair distribution (PDF) data by comparing refinement results from oversampled and resampled data. Based on nickel and a complex perovskite system, we show that not only is the optimal sampling bounded by the Nyquist interval described by the Nyquist-Shannon (NS) sampling theorem as expected, but near this sampling interval, the data points in the PDF are minimally correlated, which results in more reliable uncertainty estimates in the modelling. Surprisingly, we find that PDF refinements quickly become unstable for data on coarser grids. Although the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is well known, it has not been applied to PDF refinements, despite the growing popularity of the PDF method and its adoption in a growing number of communities. Here we give explicit expressions for the application of NS sampling theorem to the PDF case, and establish through modeling that it is working in practice, which lays the groundwork for this to become more widely adopted. This has implications for the speed and complexity of possible refinements that can be carried out many times faster than currently with no loss of information, and it establishes a theoretically sound limit on the amount of information contained in the PDF that will prevent over-parametrization during modeling.},

RMC++ is a new implementation of the RMC algorithm in C++. Its main purpose is to provide the community with a fast, flexible and documented code for RMC simulations, compatible with the rmca distribution. The source code, the documentation and the executable files are made available through the Internet. The flexibility of the code is exemplified by the implementation of a 'molecular move' step in the Metropolis algorithm. This feature, as well as a performance comparison, is illustrated with simulations performed for molecular liquids such as CCl4 and C2Cl4.},

abstract = {Visible photoluminescence (PL) broad bands are observed in the Raman spectra of SiC nanoparticles (np-SiC) with diameters ranging from 10 to 25 nm. The phenomenon is studied versus the particle size, chemical composition, annealing, and oxidation treatments. In the case of quasistoichiometric np-SiC, excitation by 514-nm radiation gives rise to broad red PL emissions mainly enhanced by the amorphous fraction of the particles and by the surface chemical disorder induced by oxidation. The PL spectra are quantitatively analyzed using numerical methods based on cluster approaches. PL bands are calculated as a function of the cluster geometry and defects (carbon and silicon vacancies), as well as the oxygen location within np-SiC sites. The relevance of this numerical analysis is discussed to account for the main features of the PL broad structure. The PL signature in SiC nanopowders can be used to monitor the physical organization of the np-SiC and to point out their amorphous structure fraction, surface states, and the defect contents.},

The core of the interface between the 30S small subunit and the 50S large subunit, where the tRNA substrates are bound, is dominated by RNA, with proteins located mainly at the periphery, consistent with ribosomal function being based on rRNA. In each of the three tRNA binding sites, the ribosome contacts all of the major elements of tRNA, providing an explanation for the conservation of tRNA structure. The tRNAs are closely juxtaposed with the intersubunit bridges, in a way that suggests coupling of the 20 to 50 angstrom movements associated with tRNA translocation with intersubunit movement.},

In constructing the PES, a variety of properties of the elements were considered, including lattice dynamics,mechanical properties, thermal behavior, energetics of competing crystal structures, defects, deformation paths, liquid structures, and so forth. For each element, the constructed EAM potentials were tested against the experiment data pertaining to thermal expansion, melting, and liquid dynamics via molecular dynamics computer simulation. The as-developed potentials demonstrate high fidelity and robustness.

abstract = {The exceptional upconverting properties of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles make them attractive systems with applications ranging from photovoltaics to biological labeling, imaging, and therapeutics. While they draw considerable interest, structural data, which are necessary to understand the upconversion process, remain scarce. In this work, we demonstrate the use of 23Na, 19F, and 89Y solid-state NMR together with DFT calculations to characterize the structure of cubic NaYF4 nanoparticles with and without Er3+ doping. By measuring 23Na MAS NMR spectra at various magnetic fields and 3QMAS spectra at ultrahigh field, we show that the spectra are characteristic of a solid solution in which cation sites are statistically occupied by Na+ or Y3+ ions. The 23Na NMR spectra are broadened as a result of isotropic chemical shift distribution, whereas the extracted quadrupolar products appear to be small (≤1.8 MHz), which is in good agreement with DFT calculations using CASTEP. The chemical shift distribution in 19F NMR spectra is well-predicted by CASTEP calculations and shown to strongly depend on coordination by Y3+. Finally, the 89Y NMR spectra consist of a single broad pattern, which also results from a chemical shift distribution that can be correlated to the coordination environment of the Y3+ cations. Our results show that the structure is a slightly distorted cubic phase and lanthanide doping has only a minor effect on the lattice parameters. The approach appears to be promising for gaining additional insight into the atomic level structure details to better understand properties that govern the upconversion process and its efficiency.},

The zinc-sulfur Einstein vibration frequency in the nanoparticles is substantially higher than that in the bulk zinc sulfide, implying structural stiffening. This cannot be explained by the observed 1{\%} radial compression and must be primarily due to inhomogeneous internal strain caused by competing relaxations from an irregular surface.

To substantiate our recent discovery we investigate a wide range of noble-transition metal nanoparticles and confirm that they expand and contract radially when treated in oxidizing (O2) and reducing (H2) atmospheres, respectively. The results are confirmed by supplementary XAFS experiments. Using computer simulations guided by the experimental diffraction data we quantify the effect in terms of both relative lattice strain and absolute atomic displacements. In particular, we show that the effect leads to a small percent of extra surface strain corresponding to several tenths of {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m displacements of the atoms at the outmost layer of the particles. The effect then gradually decays to zero within 4 atomic layers inside the particles. We also show that, reminiscent of a breathing type structural transformation, the effect is reproducible and reversible. We argue that because of its significance and widespread occurrence the effect should be taken into account in nanoparticle research.},

abstract = {This report deals with the mechanism behind the unusual behavior of nanostructures in mechanical strength, thermal stability, acoustics (lattice dynamics), photonics, electronics, magnetism, dielectrics, and chemical reactivity and its indication for designing and fabricating nanostructured materials with desired functions. A bond-order-length-strength (BOLS) correlation mechanism has been initiated and intensively verified, which has enabled the tunability of a variety of properties of a nanosolid to be universally reconciled to the effect of bond order deficiency of atoms at sites surrounding defects or near the surface edges of the nanosolid. The BOLS correlation indicates that atomic coordination imperfection causes the remaining bonds of the under-coordinated atom to contract spontaneously associated with bond strength gain and the intraatomic trapping potential well depression. Consequently, localized densification of charge, energy and mass occurs to the surface skin, which modify the atomic coherency (the product of bond number and the single bond energy), electroaffinity (separation between the vacuum level and the conduction band edge), work function, and the Hamiltonian of the nanosolid. Therefore, any detectable quantity can be functionalized depending on the atomic coherency, electroaffinity, work function, Hamiltonian or their combinations. For instances, the perturbed Hamiltonian determines the entire band structure such as the band-gap expansion, core-level shift, Stokes shift (electron-phonon interaction), and dielectric suppression (electron polarization); The modified atomic coherency dictates the thermodynamic process of the solid such as self-assembly growth, atomic vibration, phase transition, diffusitivity, sinterbility, chemical reactivity, and thermal stability. The joint effect of atomic coherency and energy density dictates the mechanical strength (surface stress, surface energy, Young's modulus), and compressibility (extensibility, or ductility) of a nanosolid. Most strikingly, a combination of the new freedom of size and the original BOLS correlation has allowed us to gain quantitative information about the single energy levels of an isolated atom and the vibration frequency of an isolated dimer, and the bonding identities in the metallic monatomic chains and in the carbon nanotubes. A survey and analysis of the theoretical and experimental observations available to date demonstrated that the under-coordinated atoms in the surface skin of 2-3 atomic layers dictate the performance of nanostructures yet atoms of the interior remain as they are in the bulk counterpart. Further extension of the BOLS correlation and the associated approaches to atomic defects, impurities, liquid surfaces, junction interfaces, and amorphous states and to the temperature domain would be more challenging, fascinating, and rewarding. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Nanocrystals of Au of 3-5 nm in diameter were studied by examining diffraction intensity oscillations around the Bragg peaks.

The high performance and stable Pr2NiO4 cathode was studied by impedance spectroscopy and dc current–potential sweeping methods. The power density in Pr2NiO4-based anode supported button cells was in the range between 0.65 and 0.7W/cm2 at 750°C at the external load of 0.8V. The degradation rate at 0.8V was approximately 3{\%} per 1000h up to 2000h. The electrode resistance is a function of external loads, thus also varies with current densities.

abstract = {Probabilistic inference is an attractive approach to uncertain reasoning and empirical learning in artificial intelligence. Computational difficulties arise, however, because probabilistic models with the necessary realism and flexibility lead to complex distributions over high-dimensional spaces. Related problems in other fields have been tackled using Monte Carlo methods based on sampling using Markov chains, providing a rich array of techniques that can be applied to problems in artificial intelligence. The "Metropolis algorithm" has been used to solve difficult problems in statistical physics for over forty years, and, in the last few years, the related method of "Gibbs sampling" has been applied to problems of statistical inference. Concurrently, an alternative method for solving problems in statistical physics by means of dynamical simulation has been developed as well, and has recently been unified with the Metropolis algorithm to produce the "hybrid Monte Carlo" method. In computer science, Markov chain sampling is the basis of the heuristic optimization technique of "simulated annealing", and has recently been used in randomized algorithms for approximate counting of large sets. In this review, I outline the role of probabilistic inference in artificial intelligence, present the theory of Markov chains, and describe various Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, along with a number of supporting techniques. I try to present a comprehensive picture of the range of methods that have been developed, including techniques from the varied literature that have not yet seen wide application in artificial intelligence, but which appear relevant. As illustrative examples, I use the problems of probabilistic inference in expert systems, discovery of latent classes from data, and Bayesian learning for neural networks.},

abstract = {The atomic structure of Ni-Pd nanoparticles has been studied using atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X-ray total scattering data and with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Larger nanoparticles have PDFs corresponding to the bulk face-centered cubic packing. However, the smallest nanoparticles have PDFs that strongly resemble those obtained from bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). In fact, by simply scaling the distance axis by the mean metallic radius, the curves may be collapsed onto each other and onto the PDF from a metallic glass sample. In common with a wide range of BMG materials, the intermediate range order may be fit with a damped single-frequency sine wave. When viewed in high-resolution TEM, these nanoparticles exhibit atomic fringes typical of those seen in small metallic clusters with icosahedral or decahedral order. These two seemingly contradictory results are reconciled by calculating the PDFs of models of icosahedra that would be consistent with the fringes seen in TEM. These model PDFs resemble the measured ones when significant atom-position disorder is introduced, drawing together the two diverse fields of metallic nanoparticles and BMGs and supporting the view that BMGs may contain significant icosahedral or decahedral order.},

abstract = {PDFgetX3 is a new software application for converting X-ray powder diffraction data to an atomic pair distribution function (PDF). PDFgetX3 has been designed for ease of use, speed and automated operation. The software can readily process hundreds of X-ray patterns within a few seconds and is thus useful for high-throughput PDF studies that measure numerous data sets as a function of time, temperature or other environmental parameters. In comparison to the preceding programs, PDFgetX3 requires fewer inputs and less user experience and it can be readily adopted by novice users. The live-plotting interactive feature allows the user to assess the effects of calculation parameters and select their optimum values. PDFgetX3 uses an ad hoc data correction method, where the slowly changing structure-independent signal is filtered out to obtain coherent X-ray intensities that contain structure informa­tion. The output from PDFgetX3 has been verified by processing experimental PDFs from inorganic, organic and nanosized samples and comparing them with their counterparts from a previous established software. In spite of the different algorithm, the obtained PDFs were nearly identical and yielded highly similar results when used in structure refinement. PDFgetX3 is written in the Python language and features a well documented reusable code base. The software can be used either as a standalone application or as a library of PDF processing functions that can be called from other Python scripts. The software is free for open academic research but requires paid license for commercial use.},

The nanostructuring correlates with a blueshift of the absorption onset and increases the photoluminescence. Our findings underscore the importance of fully characterizing and controlling the structure for improved solar cell efficiency.},

abstract = {We report selective electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide on gold nanoparticles (NPs) in 0.5 M KHCO3 at 25 °C. Among monodisperse 4, 6, 8, and 10 nm NPs tested, the 8 nm Au NPs show the maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) (up to 90{\%} at -0.67 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Density functional theory calculations suggest that more edge sites (active for CO evolution) than corner sites (active for the competitive H2 evolution reaction) on the Au NP surface facilitates the stabilization of the reduction intermediates, such as COOH*, and the formation of CO. This mechanism is further supported by the fact that Au NPs embedded in a matrix of butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate for more efficient COOH* stabilization exhibit even higher reaction activity (3 A/g mass activity) and selectivity (97{\%} FE) at -0.52 V (vs RHE). The work demonstrates the great potentials of using monodisperse Au NPs to optimize the available reaction intermediate binding sites for efficient and selective electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.},

We investigate the atomic-scale structure of 3−8 nm Au particles obtained by a fast solution reaction and find it to be of a noncrystallographic icosahedral type, in particular, close to the particles' surface. This noncrystallographic structure may well explain the previously observed but poorly understood enhancement of the particles' catalytic properties. Our finding demonstrates that together with size the structure type of nanosized particles can be used as a tunable parameter for achieving improved functionality.},
