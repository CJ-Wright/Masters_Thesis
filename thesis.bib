abstract = {For obtaining reliable nanostructural details of large amounts of sample—and if it is applicable—small-angle scattering (SAS) is a prime technique to use. It promises to obtain bulk-scale, statistically sound information on the morphological details of the nanostructure, and has thus led to many a researcher investing their time in it over the last eight decades of development. Due to pressure from scientists requesting more details on increasingly complex nanostructures, as well as the ever improving instrumentation leaving less margin for ambiguity, small-angle scattering methodologies have been evolving at a high pace over the past few decades. As the quality of any results can only be as good as the data that go into these methodologies, the improvements in data collection and all imaginable data correction steps are reviewed here. This work is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of all data corrections, to aid the small-angle scatterer to decide which are relevant for their measurement and how these corrections are performed. Clear mathematical descriptions of the corrections are provided where feasible. Furthermore, as no quality data exist without a decent estimate of their precision, the error estimation and propagation through all these steps are provided alongside the corrections.With these data corrections, the collected small-angle scattering pattern can be made of the highest standard, allowing for authoritative nanostructural characterization through its analysis. A brief background of small-angle scattering, the instrumentation developments over the years, and pitfalls that may be encountered upon data interpretation are provided as well.},

abstract = {Optimal methods are explored for obtaining one-dimensional powder pattern intensities from two-dimensional planar detectors with good estimates of their standard deviations. Methods are described to estimate uncertainties when the same image is measured in multiple frames as well as from a single frame. The importance of considering the correlation of diffraction points during the integration and the resampling process of data analysis is shown. It is found that correlations between adjacent pixels in the image can lead to seriously overestimated uncertainties if such correlations are neglected in the integration process. Off-diagonal entries in the variance-covariance (VC) matrix are problematic as virtually all data processing and modeling programs cannot handle the full VC matrix. It is shown that the off-diagonal terms come mainly from the pixel-splitting algorithm used as the default integration algorithm in many popular two-dimensional integration programs, as well as from rebinning and resampling steps later in the processing. When the full VC matrix can be propagated during the data reduction, it is possible to get accurate refined parameters and their uncertainties at the cost of increasing computational complexity. However, as this is not normally possible, the best approximate methods for data processing in order to estimate uncertainties on refined parameters with the greatest accuracy from just the diagonal variance terms in the VC matrix is explored.},

@article{Kieffer2013,
abstract = {2D area detectors like CCD or pixel detectors have become popular in the last 15 years for diffraction experiments (e.g. for WAXS, SAXS, single crystal and powder diffraction (XRPD)). These detectors have a large sensitive area of millions of pixels with high spatial resolution. The software package pyFAI has been designed to reduce SAXS, WAXS and XRPD images taken with those detectors into 1D curves (azimuthal integration) usable by other software for in-depth analysis such as Rietveld refinement, or 2D images (a radial transformation named caking). As a library, the aim of pyFAI is to be integrated into other tools like PyMca or EDNA with a clean pythonic interface. However pyFAI features also command line tools for batch processing, converting data into q-space (q being the momentum transfer) or 2$\theta$-space ($\theta$ being the Bragg angle) and a calibration graphical interface for optimizing the geometry of the experiment using the Debye-Scherrer rings of a reference sample. PyFAI shares the geometry definition of SPD but can directly import geometries determined by the software FIT2D. PyFAI has been designed to work with any kind of detector and geometry (transmission or reflection) and relies on FabIO, a library able to read more than 20 image formats produced by detectors from 12 different manufacturers. During the transformation from cartesian space (x,y) to polar space (2$\theta$, $\chi$), both local and total intensities are conserved in order to obtain accurate quantitative results. Technical details on how this integration is implemented and how it has been ported to native code and parallelized on graphic cards are discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {In situ high-energy X-ray diffraction coupled to atomic pair distribution function analysis is used to obtain fundamental insight into the effect of the reactive gas environment on the atomic-scale structure of metallic particles less than 10 nm in size. To substantiate our recent discovery we investigate a wide range of noble-transition metal nanoparticles and confirm that they expand and contract radially when treated in oxidizing (O2) and reducing (H2) atmospheres, respectively. The results are confirmed by supplementary XAFS experiments. Using computer simulations guided by the experimental diffraction data we quantify the effect in terms of both relative lattice strain and absolute atomic displacements. In particular, we show that the effect leads to a small percent of extra surface strain corresponding to several tenths of {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m displacements of the atoms at the outmost layer of the particles. The effect then gradually decays to zero within 4 atomic layers inside the particles. We also show that, reminiscent of a breathing type structural transformation, the effect is reproducible and reversible. We argue that because of its significance and widespread occurrence the effect should be taken into account in nanoparticle research.},

abstract = {PDFgetX3 is a new software application for converting X-ray powder diffraction data to an atomic pair distribution function (PDF). PDFgetX3 has been designed for ease of use, speed and automated operation. The software can readily process hundreds of X-ray patterns within a few seconds and is thus useful for high-throughput PDF studies that measure numerous data sets as a function of time, temperature or other environmental parameters. In comparison to the preceding programs, PDFgetX3 requires fewer inputs and less user experience and it can be readily adopted by novice users. The live-plotting interactive feature allows the user to assess the effects of calculation parameters and select their optimum values. PDFgetX3 uses an ad hoc data correction method, where the slowly changing structure-independent signal is filtered out to obtain coherent X-ray intensities that contain structure informa­tion. The output from PDFgetX3 has been verified by processing experimental PDFs from inorganic, organic and nanosized samples and comparing them with their counterparts from a previous established software. In spite of the different algorithm, the obtained PDFs were nearly identical and yielded highly similar results when used in structure refinement. PDFgetX3 is written in the Python language and features a well documented reusable code base. The software can be used either as a standalone application or as a library of PDF processing functions that can be called from other Python scripts. The software is free for open academic research but requires paid license for commercial use.},
