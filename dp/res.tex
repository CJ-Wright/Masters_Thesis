\section{Detector $Q$ resolution} \label{subsec:qres}
To properly azimuthaly integrate the images taken from the detector the $Q$ resolution of the pixels must be calculated.
Azimuthal integration is the process of dividing the pixels up into ``bins''.
Each bin has a set width, usually in $Q$, which describes which pixels can go into the bin.
During the integration process each pixel is placed into its corresponding bin.
Finally a statistical measurement of the average of all the pixels in each bin is taken to produce the $I(Q)$ data.
Although commonly performed, integrating using evenly spaced bins will cause pixels which are not on the same ring to be binned together, causing the incorrect value of $I(Q)$ to be obtained and a larger standard deviation in the integrated data.
To properly calculate the $Q$ resolution the resolution of each of the pixels in $2\theta$ must be calculated.

    \label{fig:scattering_digram}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:scattering_digram} shows the scattering of x-rays onto a flat image plate detector.
In this diagram the bottom of the $n$th pixel is $B$ while the top is $B'$.
The resolution of this pixel in $2\theta$ is $\angle BAC - \angle B'AC$.
Thus the resolution, calculated from the distances is
\begin{equation}
\Delta 2 \theta = \arctan{\frac{b}{d}} - \arctan{\frac{t}{d}}
\end{equation}
where d is the sample to detector distance ($AC$ in figure \ref{fig:scattering_digram}),
b is the distance to the bottom of a pixel ($CB$ in figure \ref{fig:scattering_digram})),
and t is the distance to the top of that pixel ($CB'$ in figure \ref{fig:scattering_digram})).
Note that these distances need to have been corrected for detector tilt and rotation.
Thus the resolution of a pixel in $Q$ is
\begin{equation}
\Delta Q = \frac{4\pi(\sin{\arctan{\frac{b}{d}}} - \sin{\arctan{\frac{t}{d}}})}{\lambda}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the x-ray wavelength.

This effect is analogous to looking at windows on a very tall building.
The windows are all the same size, but due to the nature of the perspective, the windows seem to shrink as one looks higher up the building.


For a Perkin Elmer image plate, like the one used at the NSLS-II's XPD and the APS's 11-ID-B, the resolution function is shown in \ref{fig:res_func}.
For the same detector the number of pixels per $Q$ is shown in \ref{fig:pixel_hist}
