\chapter{Statistical Mechanical Potential Energy Surface Minima Search}
The general strategy of my work is to use statistical mechanical ensembles to search potential energy surfaces (PESs) which include information about the atomic structure. This information will come from experimental data or computational sources like Density Functional Theory or Embedded Atom Method calculations.
