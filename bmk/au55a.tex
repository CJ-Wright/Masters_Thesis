\subsection{Au55: amorphous}
Next, we turn to the case in which the entire cluster structure is disordered. We used a DFT-optimized amorphous \ce{Au55} ($a$-\ce{Au55}) as the target structure, and
 the DFT-relaxed $c$-\ce{Au55} cluster from Case I as the starting structure. The  total energy of $a$-\ce{Au55} was computed to be  {\em lower} than that of $c$-\ce{Au55} by as large as 2.9 eV, consistent with the 3.0 eV found in previous DFT work~\cite{DaSilva2010}.

 $R_\mathrm{min}$ and $R_\mathrm{max}$ for this simulation were 2.6 \AA ~and 11.26 \AA, respectively, with $\delta Q=0.25$~\AA$^{-1}$. The simulation ran for approximately an hour,  over a total of $\sim$87 thousand configurations.  The results of the simulation are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Au55 amorphous}.

Our PDF fitting yielded a final structure of  $Rw$ of 1.7\%, whereas that of the initial structure is as high as 76.1\% (see Fig. S3 ), due to the drastically different atomic structure of the crystalline and amorphous \ce{Au55} clusters.
 Overall reasonable agreement in PDF, bond angle distribution, and radial bond distance distribution was found,  and the wide spread of the bond lengths was qualitatively reproduced.
 However, the mismatch in CNs is  problematic, partly due to the lack of information and/or constraints on the CNs.
The total energy of the final structure is computed to be $\sim 6$ eV higher than that of the target structure and the difference is substantially larger then the variation among different amorphous structures computed by DFT ($\Delta E_\mathrm{tot}\sim \pm$ 1-2 eV). Such a fitting result, despite the rather small $Rw$, clearly indicates the importance of complementary informations and/or constraints necessary for reliably solving disordered NP structures from PDF.
