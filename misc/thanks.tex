This work would not have been possible without my entire ensemble of collegues, advisors, friends, and family.
To Dr. Sanjit Ghose thank you very much for getting me started in the x-ray field and sticking with me, even when I went into the mathematical deep end.
To Dr. Yan Li, thank you very much for always pushing my simulations to be the best they could be, and pusing me to search every possible nook and cranny of parameter space.

I'd also like to thank the NSLS-II XPD team for their experimental, intelecual, and moral support.
To Dr. Thomas Caswell, Dr. Eric Dill, and Dr. Dan Allen, I would not be $1e^{-6}$ of the programmer I am today with out your guidence, conversation, and explinations.

To Prof. Scopatz, thank you very much for your insights, conversation, and being a spectacular developer role model.

To my many readers, I'd like to say thank you, if my thesis hasn't put you to sleep already.

To my parents, I don't know if any language could correctly render the magnitude of my gratitude for everything you have done for me.

Last, but certainly not least, Prof. Zhou.
I am certain that I could not have gotten a better start in research science than working with you.
