\section{Atomistic Goals}
The only way to truly understand the fundamental souce of material and chemical properties is through atomic structure.
The goal of atomistic engineering is to produce novel structures and combinations of structures to engender new properties and functions.
This includes producing stronger materials, more durable catalysts, more energy dense batteries, and many more engineering applicatons.
The true power of atomistic engineering has been shown in biochemistry and pharmicutical design.
Although the production of drugs and biomeical treatments is usually considered to be rather far from the field of catalyst design and materials science, the atomistic nature of these fields can not be denied.
The field of protiene structural analysis stands as an example of structural science, elcuidating the three dimensional coordinates of thousands of atoms.
These structures are then used to describe how the molecular machinery of the biological world works, enabling the development of new drugs and treatments for diseases and a deeper understanding of how we evolved.
The development of protene inhibiter drugs, which are important to so many treatments, would have not been possible without very detailed atomic structures.
The asperation of this work is to create this level of accuracy and utility, generating structures which allow for the understanding of how materials work on a fundamental level.

\section{Atomistic Simulations}
The goals of atomistic simulations are usually to produce atomic structures from quantum mechanical first principles, as in the case of Density Functional Theory (DFT), or classical approximations to quantum mechanics.

Maybe put the ensemble and PES work here, since it is more general than the PDF per say. Also the rational for the gradients and fast computation make much more sense knowing we are going to be very sample happy and follow the gradient of the PES.
