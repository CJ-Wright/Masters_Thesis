Engineering the next generation of materials, especially nanomaterials, requires a detailed understanding of the material's underlying atomic structure.
Understanding these structures we can obtain a better understanding of the structure-property relationship, allowing for a property driven rational design of the material structure on the atomic level.
Even more importantly, understanding the structure in-situ will allow us to reverse the flow of information, translating stimuli and responces on the macroscopic system level to changes in the atomic structure.
Despite the importance of atomic structures for designing materials, solving the atomic structure of materials is difficult.
This work aims to address this issue by developing novel statistical mechanical approaches to solving material structures, fast simulation of x-ray total scattering and atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), and data processing procedures for experimental x-ray total scattering measurements.

First, experimentally derived potential energy surfaces(PES) and the statistical mechanical ensembles used to search them are developed.
Then the mathematical and computational framework for the PDF and its gradients will be discussed.
The combined PDF-PES-ensemble system will be benchmarked against a series of nanoparticle structures to ascertain the efficency and effectivness of the system.
Experimental data processing procedures, which maximize the usable data, will be presented.
Finally, preliminary results from experimental x-ray total scattering measurements will be discussed.
This work presents one of the most complete end-to-end systems for processing and modeling x-ray total scattering PDF data, potentially allowing for high-throughput structural solution.
