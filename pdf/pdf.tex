\section{Conclusions}
In this chapter we developed the graidents of the PDF in the descrite and periodic boundary condition case.
We also developed the computational implementation of the PDF equations.
This implementaiton emphasized use of GPUs to compute the PDF and its gradient.
The GPU software was futhur sped up by mapping the computation to atom pairs rather than atom by atom.
Finally, the speed of the GPU implementation was checked against the CPU implementation via speed benchmarking.
