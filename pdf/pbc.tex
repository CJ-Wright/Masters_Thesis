\subsubsection{Periodic Boundary Conditions}
Periodic boundary conditions can be helpful when simulating extended solids or large nanoparticles. In this case all the non-crystallinity is contained within the simulation box and the box is repeated to create the longer distance peaks observed in the PDF. To perform this we can break up the Debye equation into two main parts, the part that describes the interatomic distances within the simulation box and those between boxes. Neglecting the thermal motion portion:
\begin{equation}
  F(Q) = \frac{1}{N \langle f \rangle^{2}}(\sum_{j\neq i} f_i^{*}(Q)f_j(Q) \frac{\sin(Qr_{ij})}{r_{ij}} + \sum_{i,j} f_i^{*}(Q)f_j(Q) \frac{\sin(QR_{ij})}{R_{ij}})
\end{equation}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
  R = |\vec{r} + \vec{\nu}|\\
  \vec{\nu} = \gamma_1*\vec{a} + \gamma_2*\vec{b} + \gamma_3*\vec{c}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\gamma_{i}$ is the number of copies of the simulation box in the $i$th direction, and $\vec{a}, \vec{b}, \vec{c}$ are the lattice or superlattice directions.
